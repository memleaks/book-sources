If the EvolvingLine has NaNs, Infinities as the output, don't include those points in the graph.

Give the ability to configure reduction (i.e. turn it off (?))

Look to see to reduce this.

Why isn't the subtracts on the last line getting reduced?


Wondering if the size of the expression should be figured into the fitness function. IOW 

fitness = (overall fitness of results against computed results) - (expression size)

So an evolved function that scored 12 but has 6 nodes (12 - 6 = 6) would score "less" than a function that got 10 right but is 3 nodes 
in length (10 - 3 = 7). This would favor smaller expressions - "less is more".


With adding a potential 0 into things, then...

	For divide, if a zero is on "top", replace with zero. If on "bottom", we're in trouble.

Generation 2,49658,24.829,59, a => (59 - ((51 / ((a * a) + 8)) + (0 / ((a * a) + 8))))


If there is a divide, and one side is a constant, and the other side is a divide with one leaf being a constant,
	reduce.
	
	((a / b) / c) where c and b are constants, => (a / (b * c)) => a / d
	((a / b) / c) where c and a are constants, => (a / (b * c)) => a / d


Need to handle if a function always gives NaN or Infinities for all its result set. Example:

a => (1000 / Math.Pow((a - 24), 0.5) * (Math.Pow(5, a)))

Maybe eliminate the function outright? UnstableFunctionException?


Sometime I saw an Infinity pop up into the equation. That's just flat-out wrong, gotta fix that.


More constant reduction
	if add, and what's on one side is a constant, and what's on the other side is an add or subtract with one of those sides being a constant, add the two constants together (respect the signs)
	if subtract, and what's on one side is a constant, and what's on the other side is an add or subtract with one of those sides being a constant, subract the two constants together (respect the signs)
	
Use this:

Generation 167,118480,59.24,61, a => (-85 + (63 - (44 + (-79 - (37 - (-51 / ((a - -7) - a)))))))

and this:

Generation 31,132512,66.256,80, a => ((a + 54) - (-94 / (55.0243902439024 * (43.9148936170213 - (55 + ((59.0888888888889
 + a) - 76))))))
 
for good tests of complex behavior.
